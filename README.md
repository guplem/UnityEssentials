### The university final year project

The main objective of the project is** to develop an asset that would work as a set of tools and features that the average developer would most likely need** in most of the projects made with Unity to reduce as much as possible the workload.

The latest version of the report (which still work in process) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ax8MDjtqu4DEwGvP3T8fed3Cnipw3hqd4_LfvouirJQ/edit?usp=sharing "here") and it contains objectives, references, theoretical framework, schedule and methodology and the project development among others.
